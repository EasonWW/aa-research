## Research

### 1. Here are the four winning projects of ERC4337

https://twitter.com/erc4337/status/1648305676005851136

- DayPass allows the distribution and organization of gas sponsorship via NFTs or "DayPasses".  Users that own a DayPass NFT get access to your paymaster. It's easy to use, and leverages the composability of NFTs for AA based gas sponsorship.

- Myna (üèÖ one of the winners of the main hackathon):
Over 64% of Japan‚Äôs residents have an IC-chip enabled gov-issued ID card. The Myna browser wallet lets Japanese residents have an easily recoverable hardware wallet, with just a few taps of their card.

- Autopilot taps into the programmable nature of ERC-4337 accounts, giving users a friendly UI to easily configure, schedule and automate future actions by enabling triggers, recurrence and pre-defined sequential steps.

- The Universal Paymaster team recognized the emerging market of demand (ERC-4337 wallets) and supply (paymaster operators). Their public paymaster contract matches the sides of this market by acting as a single source of liquidity for ERC-20 gas payments.

- Kudos to another winner of the main hackathon, YORU, a privacy-preserving dapp for social crypto payments. Leveraging account abstraction & stealth address. Sent to a one-time address owned by the receiver & only known by sender & receiver
