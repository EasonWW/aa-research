# AANS - Account Abstraction Grant Proposal

## Project Abstract

AANS(Account Abstraction Name Service) aims to provide a secure and user-friendly decentralized identity system for account abstraction. The solution is based on the EIP-4337 account abstraction generated contract wallet, while users can generate personalized domain AANS to replace addresses as their identity, and use this identity for application login and secure transactions, thus enhancing user experience while ensuring security.

## Objectives

Establishing a top-level AANS domain system with the .aa extension is designed for specialized contract wallets. The domain name can be registered during the wallet generation or at a later time through domain name registration. The domain name is stored in the contract account in the form of an NFT.

A registration and purchasing domain name transaction market is established with a domain-specific Paymaster, which integrates the AANS domain name service SDK. The domain name can be easily displayed in AA wallets and Dapps, and the domain name service can be resolved.

The .aa domain name can be used by multi-chain AA accounts for domain name resolution, and sub-accounts can manage domain names and contract security verification.

## Outcome

Current issues: The AA wallet makes it easy for users to enter Web3, but innovative new accounts lack good user experience and management systems.

Solution: By generating an account with a built-in domain name through AANS, it will enter Web3 in a user-readable format. Displaying the domain name within the wallet and Dapp will make it easier to manage account receipts and promotions, improving user experience. The .aa domain name is exclusively for contract wallets and can effectively manage AA accounts by performing contract checks and setting domain account security.

## Grant Scope

Four Parts: There are two ways to generate the domain name: it can be generated when the wallet is activated by the official wallet factory or registered through a domain name (similar to ENS, but with wallet interface detection during generation).

AANS SDK helps projects integrate into the AANS system, enhances user experience, and reduces user access barriers.

AANS registration and trading platform allows for purchasing, renewing, adding sub-functions, and Paymasters.

AANS cross-chain registration module and sub-account module enable secure management and extended functionality for domain names.
