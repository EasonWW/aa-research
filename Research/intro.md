Hi! I am Sky, the founder of accountjs and the AA Chinese Community. 
Our team only has 3 developers and due to a lack of people, we rarely interact with the outside world. Accountjs is a platform that integrates of various AA infrastructures and uses excellent implementations. Our original intention is to make it a public goods like ethers.js, reducing the threshold for developers and users. 
Recently, our focus has been on the AA Chinese Community, connecting projects and helping each other to build and research. We are a non-profit open-source organization and currently have a community of 160 people in wechat of multiple Chinese DAOs, with most being developers. And we formed a service team this week, including development and operations, all with their passion. Our aim is to have an open community and help excellent Chinese dapp developers connect with international projects, assist in designing integration solutions, and help excellent application projects and developers to join AA ecosystems, leading open-source practices.

Our current work includes:

1. I am still researches and organizes AA Weekly every week. Now is the 9th. 
This idea was formed before ETHDenver, we found a lot of infras and dapps recently.

2. We previously studied EIP and proposed a unified account standard, which is important for client SDKs. 
We initially thought about interconnecting wallet ecosystems and recovery interfaces, and to design module implementation was more important. 
We are currently discussing this again in the community.

3. We have started to contact overseas ecosystems, like 4337Mafia and JiffyScan. 
We are preparing to contact more and help write articles and integrate them into excellent applications. 
We still want more support to in contact with most of the infrastructure projects that are open to communication.

4. The community has recently been systematized, and we are improving the community wiki and gathering outstanding projects and documents. 
We will list existing projects and their requirements in the community Notion document.

5. As we are mostly developers, we are gathering developers to participate in hackathons or develop applications. 
We previously worked on an aa+zk recovery demo, but our team members did not demonstrate it at ETHTokyo. 
We are currently trying to adapt more application scenarios and serve developers as platform to share.

This is our previous work. Since last year, I have always believed that AA is not lacking in excellent user experience, but lacks application scenarios. 
Quality scenario experience relies on excellent infrastructure. Recently, we have focused more on connecting more projects and scenario-based applications.

As a Chinese community, we build a bridge for most Chinese dapp developers to connect to outside world, promoting new blockchain technology. 
Chinese Web3 developers have a lot applications, we help them to dive deeper and integrate AA, reducing some repeated work to adapt to ERC4337.
